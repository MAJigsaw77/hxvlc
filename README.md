* MacOS **(x86_64 and arm64 only)**.
* Linux.

        ```

   * Or through `Git`, if you want the latest updates
        ```bash
        haxelib git hxvlc https://github.com/MAJigsaw77/hxvlc.git
        ```

2. Add this code in the **project.xml** file.

    ```xml
    <section if="cpp">
    	<haxelib name="hxvlc" if="desktop || mobile" />
    </section>
    ```

3. ***Linux users only***, you need to install [`vlc`](https://www.videolan.org/vlc) from your distro's package manager.

    * [Debian](https://debian.org) based distributions:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev libvlccore-dev vlc-bin
        ```

    * [Arch](https://archlinux.org) based distributions:
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -S vlc
        ```

    * [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org) based distributions:
        ```bash
        sudo emerge media-video/vlc
        ```
4. ***iOS users only***, you need to add the MobileVLCKit framework.

    * [Precompiled Framework](https://download.videolan.org/cocoapods/prod/MobileVLCKit-3.1.0-1773552-3afa138bb6.tar.xz)

    * [Self Building the Framework](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/tree/3.1.0)
